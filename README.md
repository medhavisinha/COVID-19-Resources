## About The Project

There are many websites available on the internet regarding Covid-19 and the resources, however, we didn't find one that really covered hospitals and resources in Mumbai and Suburban Mumbai region at one place.

 The top features in our project are:
* You can view the availability of hospitals with one single click. 
* You can update the resources present in hospitals or add hospitals by logging-in or signing up respectively.

### Built With

We used following languages mainly for our website:
* HTML (for front-end)
* CSS (for front-end)
* Python (for complete back-end)
